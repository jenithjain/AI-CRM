   - An ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that takes data from various formats (e.g., CSV, Excel) and migrates it to MongoDB.
   - Supports automated data transformation for structured ingestion, facilitating seamless integration from legacy systems.

### 2. **Customer Segmentation**
   - Clusters customers based on purchase history, engagement levels, and demographics using K-Means clustering.
   - Allows the business to personalize marketing and support for each segment.

### 3. **Churn Prediction**
   - Predicts customers at risk of churning using a machine learning model, based on factors like engagement history and purchase patterns.
   - Generates actionable recommendations to reduce churn and improve retention.


### 4. **Sentiment Analysis on Customer Feedback**
   - Uses NLP to assess customer sentiment, categorizing feedback as positive, negative, or neutral.
   - Extracts key themes to help businesses identify product strengths and improvement areas.
